# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

_iDEA bOX_
Idea Box is a web app created in Rails and deployed to Heroku at:

Users can create ideas and associate their ideas with categories and images as a way to keep track of and organize ideas. Administrators are able to create and destroy Categories and Images.
This application was inspired by the Turing School of Software and Design, and developed by Lauren Billington.


_General Information_

Idea Box makes use of the Ruby on Rails framework and Active Record, with a PostgreSQL database.

*Links to online tools related to the application (e.g.: Links to the Basecamp project, a link to the dropbox where all the wireframes are stored, a link to the Pivotal Tracker project)*


_Getting Started_

The “Getting Started” section outlines the process of getting the app installed and usable for a developer. I define ‘usable’ in this context as able to login to the application and access all of the functionality available.

Information you might want to include is:

A detailed spin-up process. This should include:
Instructions on installing any software the application is dependent on: e.g.: wkhtmltopdf, PostgreSQL, XQuartz.

Instructions on running the app. For rails apps you’ll want to include the rake db:create db:migrate db:seed process here, as well as instructions on starting a server (e.g. are we using pow, or just the default `rails s`)

A list of credentials that can be used to log in with each user type in the system and ideally the URL that a developer can log in from.

Any information about subdomains in the app (e.g.: api.myapp.dev/)

When writing instructions pretend you’re writing them for someone who knows next to nothing about developing in the framework/language your application uses.

_Testing_

All you need to include in the “Testing” section is the commands to run any of the test suites you have (e.g.: RSpec, Jasmine, Cucumber, Spinach) and any setup you need to do before-hand (e.g.: rake db:test:prepare). This section will be small but vital.

_Staging and Production environments_

The staging and production environment sections (one section per environment) should provide any information a developer might need to know about these environments.

Information you might want to include is:

Which server is the application on? Is it on Amazon Sydney? A server in the office? A data-centre down the road?
How can a developer connect to the server? Do they need particular permissions? Who do they need to talk to to get those permissions?
Where on the server is the application located
What is the deploy process for this server
Are there any other services on the box related to the app a developer will need to know about? Any cron jobs? Some Resque workers?
