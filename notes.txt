still to do:
*  images presented as checkboxes or radio buttons - on new and edit views
*  make sure users can't see each others ideas.
    Users can create, edit/update, show, and destroy only their own ideas.
      PROBLEM! now no one can log in?
*  styling - bootstrap, or scss and flexbox stuff?
*  make nav bar have if/else with logout/login...wrap in a method?
Check specs and see if there is other stuff that I need to do.


Other things to do this weekend:
 - CFUs
 - Ruby/AR Obstacle Course.
 - SQL and AR more? how to make projects for myself? try to do BikeShare logistics?
 - play with flexbox and sass.
 - What to do with Lovisa?
 - go over cart creation a few times...maybe try to add a cart to my idea box?
   - is there other stuff that could be done with a cart-type-feature? session data that is stored while someone is logged in?
    - OR look into the next project...not just a cart, but how to go from cart items all the way through checkout?
 - review ruby stuff?



After that we need to whitelist expertise_ids in /app/controllers/professors_controller.rb:

params.require(:professor).permit(:name, expertise_ids:[])

<div class="field">
  <%= f.label "Area of Expertise" %><br />
  <%= f.collection_check_boxes :expertise_ids, Expertise.all, :id, :name do |b| %>
    <div class="collection-check-box">
      <%= b.check_box %>
      <%= b.label %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
</div>
